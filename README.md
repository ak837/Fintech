Create a combination of .html .css and is files that when placed in the same folder allow a browser to render a web page that present the user with a game that teaches the user something about financial literacy. Write down the concept from finance that you are teaching, and then create the game. There are many examples you can find online any code you adapt, just acknowledge where it came from. The game should involve the user having to solve some kind of puzzle, generated randomly, with indication as to what the player scored (whether they got something right or wrong).
